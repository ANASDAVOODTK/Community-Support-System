# Community Support System - Waste Management & Disaster Relief

## Introduction
     This study aims to illustrate how to make use of modern technologies like IoT, Cloud and LoRa to provide an effective Community Support System for Waste Management  & Disaster Relief.
          This is done by interconnecting all the houses in a Local Gram Panchayat, which is then further connected to a District Panchayat. Sensors embedded with Lora Technology in the waste bins, uses an intelligent low-power wide-area network based on the LoRaWAN protocol. This enables connectivity, real-time analytics reporting and functions such as geolocation. Thus, various features like: Sending SOS/ distress signal to the concerned authorities, Keeping cities cleaner by preventing waste bin overflow. Information on disaster relief camps etc can be done with ease.

## Aim 
    The main aim of our project is to make the communication among the houses and with the local body feasible and reliable during natural calamities along with waste management.
